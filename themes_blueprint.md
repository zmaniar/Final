## Blueprint is a foundation from which developers can easily create great themes

When creating a new theme we suggest that you start from our base theme, Blueprint.

Blueprint is a great starting point for theme development because it supports the most recent features of our platform. Blueprint includes responsive support out-of-the-box, so it works with lower resolutions like those on mobile devices. The visual design has been stripped back so you can create from a clean canvas.

## Setting up your environment

Follow these steps to start developing using the Blueprint theme:

1.  To enable the Blueprint theme on your store simply login to the control panel, and place "**/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable**" after "/admin".
    (i.e. https://store-123abmy.mybigcommerce.com/admin/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable)
2.  Apply the Blueprint theme
3.  Connect to the site via [WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/questions/1513/How+do+I+connect+to+WebDAV%3F).
4.  Once connected via WebDav, navigate to the "template" folder where you will have access to all the files that make up a theme.
5.  To make a change to a file, just download the file, edit and then upload it after you have made the change.
6.  Everytime you make changes to any files you will need to upload them through WebDAV for the changes to be reflected on your site.
