Bigcommerce’s default theme (Classic Next) was designed according to these guidelines:

*   Use the `styles.css` file for all theme-specific styling
*   Reserve the `theme.css` file, generated by [Style Editor](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/themes/style-editor)'s `theme.less` file, for Style Editor–specific styling.
*   Ensure that `HTMLhead.html` contains the `%%GLOBAL_Stylesheets%%` variable.
*   Ensure that the %%Panel.TopMenu%% panel is available across all templates.
*   Ensure that 403 and 404 pages are styled to match the theme's overall design.
